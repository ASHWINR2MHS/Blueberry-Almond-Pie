Pastry: Crumble the butter, flour and ground almonds through your fingers till you get a crumbly mixture. Then mix the egg yolk with the caster sugar. Add the egg mixture in small amounts to the crumbly flour mixture while mixing with a stand mixer with a dough hook or a  large spatula. Knead the dough for 2 minutes and then wrap the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for about  10 minutes. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll it  on a floured surface. Transfer it to a 8 inch tart pan. Mould the dough according to the tart pan. Place in the fridge for 30-40 minutes. Remove out of the fridge before making the jam.
Frangipane: Beat the butter, caster sugar and lemon rind until a fluffy paste forms. Mix in the two eggs. Finally add all the dry ingredients until a creamy paste forms. Wrap it with plastic wrap and let it set in the fridge for 20 minutes. Take out of the fridge before making the jam.
Blueberry Jam: Mix blueberries, sugar and lemon juice, in a saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until thickened, about 30 minutes. Cool down for 10 minutes.
Assembly: Preheat the oven to 220 for 15 minutes. Take out all of the components from the fridge. Spread 2 tablespoons of blueberry. Spread the frangipane on top of the jam using an offset spatula. Make sure that the jam doesnâ€™t come over the frangipane.
Bake for 20 minutes at 200 while constantly checking at 5 minute intervals. Enjoy with Chantilly cream!!!
